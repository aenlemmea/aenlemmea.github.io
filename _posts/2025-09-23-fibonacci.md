## Definitions

Fibonacci Sequence : A sequence of integers $F_0, F_1, \cdots$ such that $F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n - 2}$ for all $n \geqslant 1$, with, $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$. 

Lucas Sequence: $L_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n + 1}$

Golden Ratio: $\phi =	\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$

Binet's Formula:

$$F_{n}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}\right)^{n}-\frac{(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\right)^{n}$$

for $n \geq 0$.

## Properties

1. (Strong Divisibility)  
    $$\gcd(F_n, F_m) = F_{\gcd(n,m)}$$

2. (GCD Rule)  
    $$\gcd(F_n, F_{n-1}) = 1$$

3. (Divisibility Sequence)  
    $$m \mid n \implies F_m \mid F_n$$

4. (Cassini's Identity)  
    $$F_{n-1}F_{n+1} - F_n^2 = (-1)^n$$

5. (Matrix Power Form)  
    $$
    \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1\\1 & 0\end{pmatrix}^n =
    \begin{pmatrix}F_{n+1} & F_n\\F_n & F_{n-1}\end{pmatrix}
    $$

6. (Parity) If $F_n$ is even iff $n$ is divisible by $3$

7. (Lucas Identity)  
    $$F_n^2 + F_{n+1}^2 = F_{2n+1}$$

8. (Fibonacci Generating Function)  
    $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} F_n x^n = \frac{x}{1-x-x^2}$$

9. (Finite Sum)  
    $$F_1 + F_2 + \cdots + F_n = F_{n+2} - 1$$

10. (Balls and Urns Formulation)  
    $$F_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \binom{n-k-1}{k} \quad \text{or} \quad
    \sum_{k=1}^{n} \binom{n-k}{k-1}$$

11. (Fibonacci Limit Theorem)  
    $$\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n} = \phi$$

12. (Gap Telescope)  
    $$\frac{1}{F_{n-1}F_{n+1}} = \frac{1}{F_{n-1}F_n} - \frac{1}{F_n F_{n+1}}$$

13. (Difference Rule)  
    $$F_n F_{n+1} = F_n^2 + F_{n-1}F_n$$

14. (Square Sum)  
    $$\sum_{k=1}^{n} F_k^2 = F_n F_{n+1}$$

15. (Double Sum)  
    $$F_m F_{n+1} + F_{m-1} F_n = F_{n+m}$$

16. (Triple Sum)  
    $$F_a F_{a+b+c} - F_{a+b} F_{a+c} = (-1)^{a+1} F_b F_c$$

17. (First Form Inequality)  
    $$F_k > F_{k-2} + F_{k-3} + \cdots + F_2$$

18. (Sum of the First $n$ Odd-Indexed)  
    $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{2i-1} = F_{2n}$$

19. (Sum of the First $n$ Even-Indexed)  
    $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_{2i} = F_{2n+1} - 1$$

20. (Gelin-Ces√†ro Identity)  
    $$F_n^4 - F_{n-2} F_{n-1} F_{n+1} F_{n+2} = 1, \quad n \ge 3$$

## Fact File

Fact 1: The only Fibonacci numbers that are squares are $0, 1, 144.$ [Proof](https://math.la.asu.edu/~checkman/SquareFibonacci.html#intro)

Fact 2: Every positive integer $m$, there is a Fibonacci number divisible by $m$. [Proof](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1523198/proving-that-every-integer-has-a-fibonacci-number-multiple) also see, [AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c6h2231614p17047441)

Fact 3: A number $x$ is fibonacci if $5x^2 \pm 4$ is a square. Another way to test if a number is fibonacci is to invert binet's formula.

Fact 4: The ratio of two successive term in the Fibonacci Sequence, i.e, $\displaystyle G_n = \frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}$

## Theorems

* Theorem[Zeckendorf]: Every positive integer can be represented `uniquely` as the sum of one or more Fibonacci numbers in such a way that the sum does not include any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

* Theorem[Counting]: 

   + $F_{n}$ is the number of binary sequences of length $n-2$ with no consecutive 0 s.
   + $F_{n}$ is the number of subsets of ${1,2, \ldots, n-2}$ that do not contain any pair of consecutive numbers.

*  Theorem: All the odd divisors of Fibonacci numbers with odd subscripts are of
the form $4t + 1$

 * Theorem: Let $r \in \mathbb{N}$. The Fibonacci numbers modulo $r$ form a periodic sequence.
